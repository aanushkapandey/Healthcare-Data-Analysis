# 🏥 Healthcare Admission Analysis – Trends in Conditions, Billing, and Demographics

## 📌 Objective  
To analyze hospital admission records and uncover trends across patient demographics, medical conditions, billing, and test outcomes. The project aims to assist healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation, treatment planning, and patient care optimization.
